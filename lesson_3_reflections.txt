When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?

  Well, in my opinion, it might be useful to create a remote repository for a shared project with other peoples and even with myself so I can track down every modifications on each computer I may use to work on my project.
  Moreover, it helps me having a look about all the commit and stuff in real time.
