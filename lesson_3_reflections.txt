When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local ?

  Well, in my opinion, it might be useful to create a remote repository for a shared project with other peoples and even with myself so I can track down every modifications on each computer I may use to work on my project.
  Moreover, it helps me having a look about all the commit and stuff in real time
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  It's a better way to pull changes manually as long as you don't now what other peoples might do on your repository.
  And it's about the same about pushing commit and stuff to GitHub

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  Forks is for eating, clones don't exists and branches are full of leaves.
